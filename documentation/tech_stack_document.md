# Tech Stack Document for `veo-3-vertical-project`

This document explains, in plain language, all the major technology choices behind the vea-3-vertical-project backend service. You don’t need a developer background to understand why each piece is here and how it helps the system work smoothly.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

This project is built as a backend service (an API) and does not include a user-facing web or mobile interface. Instead, any frontend or client can talk to it using standard HTTP requests (for example, via Postman, curl, or a custom dashboard). If you later decide to build a web or mobile app on top of this API, you could choose tools like React, Vue, or Flutter – but none are required for version 1.

## 2. Backend Technologies

We chose technologies that make it easy to handle data tasks, file uploads, and exports, all in a scalable, maintainable way.

- **Node.js (v18+)**
  - A popular, server-side JavaScript runtime. It lets us write our backend in JavaScript/TypeScript and handle many simultaneous requests.
- **TypeScript**
  - Adds static types to JavaScript. This helps catch errors early, makes the code easier to understand, and improves long-term maintainability.
- **Express.js** (or Fastify)
  - A lightweight web framework for Node.js. It handles HTTP routes and middleware in a clear, modular way.
- **Prisma ORM**
  - A type-safe database toolkit. We define our data models in `schema.prisma` and Prisma generates a client library for easy, reliable database queries (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite).
- **BullMQ with Redis**
  - A robust job queue system backed by Redis. Long-running tasks—like data generation or export—get pushed into Redis queues and processed separately, so our API stays quick.
- **Multer (or similar middleware)**
  - Handles file uploads by streaming multipart form data. This prevents out-of-memory issues when clients upload large files.
- **dotenv / Config Module**
  - Loads environment variables (database URLs, Redis connection strings, file paths) so that settings can change per environment (development, staging, production).
- **Winston or Pino**
  - Structured logging libraries. They let us record important events, errors, and performance data in a consistent format.
- **Jest or Mocha**
  - Testing frameworks for writing unit and integration tests, ensuring our core features work as expected.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

We set up a straightforward, reliable environment that’s easy to version-control and automate.

- **Git & GitHub**
  - All code lives in a Git repository, hosted on GitHub. This gives us history, collaboration tools, and code review workflows.
- **GitHub Actions (or similar CI/CD)**
  - Automates steps like linting, testing, and deployment whenever code is pushed or a pull request is opened.
- **Docker (recommended)**
  - Containerizes the application so it runs the same way on any host. You can build a Docker image and deploy it to container services (AWS ECS, Kubernetes, etc.).
- **Environment-specific Configuration**
  - Using `.env` files or secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) to keep credentials out of source code.
- **Hosting Platforms**
  - The service can be deployed anywhere that supports Node.js and Redis—cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premises servers.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

To extend functionality without reinventing the wheel, we rely on a few external services and libraries:

- **Redis**
  - A fast, in-memory data store that BullMQ uses to manage job queues.
- **AWS S3 (or S3-compatible storage)**
  - Stores uploaded files and exported data files. S3 is durable and scalable.
- **Bull Board (optional)**
  - A web UI for monitoring queue health, job status, and failures.
- **Express Middleware Ecosystem**
  - Libraries for validation (e.g., `joi`), security headers (`helmet`), CORS handling, and more.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

Keeping data safe and the API snappy are top priorities.

Security Measures:
- **Input Validation**
  - We validate request payloads (JSON bodies and file uploads) to prevent malicious input.
- **Parameterized Queries**
  - Prisma automatically uses parameterized SQL, protecting against injection attacks.
- **Environment Variable Secrets**
  - No credentials are hard-coded. We rely on `.env` or secret stores.
- **HTTPS / TLS**
  - Communications should run over HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit.

Performance Optimizations:
- **Asynchronous Queues**
  - Offload heavy jobs (generation, export) to background workers so the main API responds quickly (typically < 200 ms).
- **Streaming File Uploads**
  - Using Multer’s streaming mode to avoid buffering large files in memory.
- **Connection Pooling**
  - Prisma and Redis clients use pools to manage many concurrent connections efficiently.
- **Horizontal Scaling**
  - We can run multiple API instances and worker processes behind a load balancer or orchestrator to handle increased load.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In summary, this project’s tech stack was chosen to deliver a fast, reliable, and maintainable backend service:

- A **Node.js + TypeScript** foundation for modern, type-safe server logic
- **Express.js**, **Prisma**, and **BullMQ/Redis** to build clear APIs, safe database access, and scalable background processing
- **Multer**, **Winston/Pino**, and **dotenv** to handle files, logs, and configuration securely
- **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, and cloud-agnostic deployment patterns for smooth delivery and version control

Together, these technologies ensure that data generation, file upload, and data export tasks run smoothly, stay secure, and can grow with your needs. If you ever need to add a frontend, monitoring tools, or more advanced security features, this stack provides a solid base from which to expand.
