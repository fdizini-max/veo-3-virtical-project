# App Flow Document for the Data Task Management API

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new developer or system integrator first encounters this application, they typically discover it through its public repository or a documentation portal. They clone the repository to their local machine, install dependencies using a simple command, and prepare environment variables for database, queue, and storage connections. There are no user accounts or login screens in this version of the API because it trusts its clients. Once the environment variables are set, the developer runs the startup script and the server comes online. There is no sign-up form or password reset flow, since authentication is out of scope in the first release.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After the server starts, a simple health check becomes available at the root endpoint. A GET request to the base URL returns a small JSON object confirming the service name, its version, and the current status of the database and queue connections. This response serves as the default view of the API, acting like the home page. In that JSON, links or names of the three main functions—data generation, file upload, and data export—are clearly shown so the developer knows exactly where to send requests next. From this health check response, they can navigate to any of the core endpoints by changing the path to `/generate`, `/upload`, `/export`, or `/status/{jobId}`.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

### Data Generation Flow
The developer initiates a data generation task by sending a POST request to the `/generate` endpoint with a JSON body describing parameters such as the number of records or the desired data schema. The API verifies that the JSON fields match its expected format. If everything is valid, the endpoint immediately responds with a 202 Accepted status and a unique job identifier. Behind the scenes, the API enqueues this job in the generation queue and returns control to the client without waiting for the job to finish.

Once the job is enqueued, a separate worker process picks it up from the queue. The worker reads the parameters, uses the ORM to write new records into the database, and updates the job’s status field. When the worker completes its task, the status becomes “completed.” The client can then check this job’s status by making a GET request to `/status/{jobId}`.

### File Upload Flow
To upload a file, the developer sends a multipart/form-data POST request to the `/upload` endpoint. The upload middleware streams the file into a temporary or cloud storage location, checking file size and type along the way. If the file passes validation, the middleware hands off control to the route handler. The handler then responds with a 201 Created status and provides a new job identifier for any further processing. If the file fails validation—for example, if it is too large—the API returns a 400 Bad Request with an error message.

Behind the scenes, there may be another queue task to parse or analyze the uploaded file, but in the first release the API simply stores the file and marks the upload job as completed.

### Data Export Flow
When the developer needs to export data, they send a POST request to `/export` with a JSON payload that can include filters such as date range or record type. The endpoint validates the filters and enqueues an export job in the export queue. Immediately after enqueuing, it returns a 202 Accepted response along with a job identifier.

A worker process later picks up this export job, queries the database using the filters, transforms the results into the requested CSV or JSON format, and writes the export file to storage. When the file is ready, the worker updates the job status and adds a download link to the job record.

### Job Status and Retrieval Flow
At any point after enqueuing a job, the developer can check its status by sending a GET request to `/status/{jobId}`. The API returns a JSON object that shows the job type, its current status (pending, in-progress, failed, or completed), and, if completed, a link or path to the generated file. If the job failed, the response includes an error message. Once the developer sees that the status is completed, they can use the provided link to download the file or view the generated data.

## Settings and Account Management

Since this API does not have user accounts, there is no user-facing settings page. Instead, configuration is managed through environment variables or a central configuration file. The developer can adjust settings such as database connection strings, Redis queue URLs, file storage paths, and limits on file size. After updating the configuration, the developer restarts the server process to apply the changes. This simple approach gives full control over behavior without any in-app settings interface.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If a request arrives with invalid JSON or missing required fields, the API responds with a 400 Bad Request error and a short message explaining which fields are wrong. For file uploads, a file that exceeds the size limit or has the wrong format yields a 400 error with a clear message. If the queue service is unavailable or the database cannot be reached, the root endpoint returns a 503 Service Unavailable status, and other endpoints respond with 500 Internal Server Error until the underlying problem is fixed. When a job fails in the worker process, the worker updates the job status to failed and logs the error. The client sees this failure when polling `/status/{jobId}` and can choose to correct the input and try again.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

A typical developer journey starts with cloning the codebase and configuring required variables. They run the service and confirm connectivity via the health check. From there, they trigger a data generation task, upload a file, or request a data export by calling the respective endpoint. Each request returns quickly with a job ID, and the developer polls the status endpoint to follow progress. When jobs complete, the developer retrieves results via provided links. Throughout this workflow, clear error messages guide them in case of invalid input or system outages. This design keeps the API responsive by offloading heavy work to background queues, ensuring a smooth experience from initial setup to final data retrieval.
